# Story
I am Capt. Olivia Swan, and I am a, well let's call me a privateer. I try to do my own thing. For instance, freelance asteroid mining in this Federation asteroid field. This is my glorious rust bucket, the SS Swansong, a FX-2117A Aurora class fighter. I picked her in a junk yard some 13 years ago, when my old captain abandoned me planetside after helping himself to my creds. She was a hunk of junk back then, and she's still a hunk of junk. But I knew a hidden gem when I saw one. She deserved better. One last song. She doesn't have the loadout of a modern fighter, but there isn't a ship in this part of the universe as stealthy. Keep off the throttle to keep her EM Rad down and there's nothing we can't sneak past. That shouldn't be hard, it's not like we can afford the fuel anyway.

This is home, an old federation radiation satellite that I've... co-opted... so that I freely participate in the federation market without anyone paying too much attention. This were I can come back to whenever I have cargo to sell. I've added my own anti velocity ring to auto brake the ship whenever I'm in range. It's best if we keep this spot secret from the federation ships. I don't think they'd take too kindly to its continued existence.

Speaking of the free market, this captain needs to eat and to do that, I need some credits. The easiest way to collect credits is to mine asteroids and sell the minerals. There's an asteroid nearby that is suitable. Shoot it with your mining laser until all the pieces have been collected.
