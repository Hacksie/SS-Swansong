  shortDescription: Distress beacon
  description: I've picked up a nearby distress beacon. Normally I wouldn't be so
    stupid to fall into such a trap, but the signal seems to be coming from another
    FX-2117A Aurora, which is like finding a unicorn. I can't not check it out. Still,
    I should take some AS-39's with me
