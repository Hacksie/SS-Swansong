  shortDescription: We have to eat
  description: "This is home, an old federation radiation satellite that I've... co-opted...
    so that I freely participate in the federation market without anyone paying too
    much attention. This were I can come back to whenever I have cargo to sell. It's
    best if we keep this spot secret from the federation ships. I don't think they'd
    take too kindly to it.\n\r\nSpeaking of the free market, this captain needs to
    eat and to do that, I need some credits. The easiest way to collect credits is
    to mine asteroids and sell the minerals. There's an asteroid nearby that is suitable.
    Shoot it with your mining laser until all the pieces have been collected. "
